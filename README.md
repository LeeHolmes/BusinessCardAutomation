Automate a media PC through image recognition of barcodes on business cards.

Using a media PC to control your entertainment center is a great idea, and is becoming much more common.  With a little persistence, media PCs sit at the center of a powerful, integrated, and unique entertainment hub.  In addition, you can build your own fairly inexpensively – especially when compared to the brand name ones.

Unfortunately, most input to a media PC comes through an infrared or radio-driven remote.  In the end, you’re controlling a full-fledged computer with a high-tech (yet slow and cumbersome) mouse.  For example, opening a music playlist usually involves these steps:

1)	Turn on the TV (the computer is already on.)
2)	Pick up your remote control, and use the clumsy d-pad to move the mouse pointer to “My Music.”
3)	Use the clumsy double-click buttons, and clumsier d-pad cursor movements to navigate to your desired playlist.
4)	Double click the playlist to load it in your media player.
5)	Song plays.
6)	Turn off the TV and let the music play.
7)	(time passes…)
8)	Turn on the TV
9)	Navigate to the “Close” button of your media player, and click it.  If you’re lucky, the remote has a button that makes this step easier.
10)	Turn off the TV

With Command Card Recognizer, on the other hand, you’ll only need these steps:
	
1)	Find the card for the song or playlist you want to play.
2)	Place the card in the holder, in front of a webcam.
3)	Song plays.
4)	(time passes…)
5)	Place the stop card in the holder.
